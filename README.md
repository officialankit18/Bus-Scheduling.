# 🚌 Automated Bus Scheduling and Route Management System (Delhi)

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to modernize and optimize the public transportation infrastructure in Delhi by introducing an **Automated Bus Scheduling, Route Planning, and Management System**. The system uses intelligent scheduling, real-time route optimization, and RPG (Route Performance Graph) analysis to enhance commuter experience, reduce congestion, and improve operational efficiency.

## 🔧 Features

- 🕒 **Automated Bus Scheduling**
  - Real-time and dynamic scheduling of buses based on demand and traffic conditions(on the basis of maps traffic data).
  - Peak and off-peak hour optimization.

- 🗺️ **Route Management**
  - Smart route suggestions for optimal coverage and minimum congestion.
  - Alternate routing based on real-time data (e.g., traffic, road closures).

- 📊 **RPG (Route Performance Graph)**
  - Visualization of performance metrics like on-time rate, ridership, congestion, etc.
  - Data-driven decision-making for route improvements.

- 📍 **Live Tracking and Notifications**
  - Real-time tracking of buses.
  - ETA and live updates for commuters via web/mobile app(in Beta).

- 👨‍💻 **Admin Dashboard**
  - View reports, manage routes, assign buses and drivers.
  - Upload traffic updates and maintenance schedules.

- 👷‍♂️ **Smart Driver Assignment**
  - Assignment of drivers is handled intelligently to ensure fair workload distribution.
  - A minimum rest period of **30 minutes** is guaranteed between consecutive shifts for all drivers.
  - The system avoids overloading drivers by checking their availability, previous duty hours, and rest duration before assignment.
  - In case of driver shortages, alternate available drivers are notified through the system in real time.
